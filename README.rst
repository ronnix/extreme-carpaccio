Extreme Carpaccio
=================

Written by Ronan and Bowie for the Extreme Carpaccio kata
at the Paris Software Craftsmanship meetup.

We implemented our client in Python using the Pyramid framework.

To run the server (preferrably in a virtualenv)::

    $ python setup.py develop
    $ pserve --reload --monitor-restart development.ini
